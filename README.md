# AMYRA

**AMYRA** — **Adaptive Multimodal Yielding Real-time Architecture**

Amyra is a local-first, real-time conversational AI system designed to feel **present**, **interruptible**, and **human** — without depending on the cloud.

It is not a chatbot.
It is not a single model.
It is a stable, extensible **conversation pipeline**.

## Why AMYRA?

Most conversational AI systems optimize for:
- Model size
- Cloud scale
- Perfect answers

Amyra optimizes for something else:

> **Presence.**

Amyra listens first, responds quickly, yields when interrupted, and runs locally by default.  
Accuracy improves over time — but **real-time interaction comes first**.

## What AMYRA Stands For

**A**daptive  
**M**ultimodal  
**Y**ielding  
**R**eal-time  
**A**rchitecture  

Each word is intentional:

- **Adaptive** — Responds to user intent, emotion, and timing
- **Multimodal** — Voice today, video and avatars tomorrow
- **Yielding** — Stops speaking when the user speaks (barge-in by design)
- **Real-time** — Low latency is a core feature, not an optimization
- **Architecture** — A system, not a demo or a single model

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Presence Over Performance
Fast enough beats perfect.
Natural pauses beat instant replies.

### 2. Local-First by Default
Amyra runs on your machine:
- No mandatory cloud calls
- No surprise billing
- Works offline

Cloud integration is optional and replaceable.

### 3. Interruptibility Is a Feature
If the user speaks, Amyra stops.
No monologues. No talking over people.

### 4. Stable Pipeline, Replaceable Parts
The architecture does not change.
Only the engines do.
